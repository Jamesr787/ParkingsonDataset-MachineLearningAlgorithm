# ParkingsonDataset-MachineLearningAlgorithm
Random Forests Regressor Vs Gradient Boosting Regressor on Parkinson's Dataset (Scikit-Learn)

The goal of this project was to compare an optimized Random Forests Regressor to an optimized Gradient Boosting Regressor.
A K-fold cross-validation strategy (RandomizedSearchCV) was used to optimize each regressor.
The regressors were compared by their normalized Root Squared Mean Error (RMSE).
